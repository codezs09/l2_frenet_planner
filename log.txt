06.01
- interface change from ctypes to cpp call

06.02~06.04
- change car and obstacle class and methods
- refactor CubicSpline2D method
- Refactor to_frenet and to_cartesian methods

06.05
- Add ToFrenet and ToCartesian methods for Obstacle class
- Update ego car pose and obstacle poses to next state in the loop

06.06
- refactor Car getPose methods
- finish main loop framework

06.07
- box to box collision detection
- if not collided, then calculate box to box distance calculation (at the end it's point to line problem)
- add rotate and pose_to_box utils
- add getBox method for Obstacle and Car class
- improve is_collision speed by avoiding unnecessary SAT check
- refactor is_collision method for FrenetPath class

CHANGES: 
- may use pybind11 instead of ctypes. Tried but vector size change not supported.

- update methods w.r.t obstables: isCollision, etc. 
- change obstacle representation to four corners
- Add moving cars  ->  Needs fake Prediction module
- Change planning frequency to 10 Hz
- Add more lanes, add lane deciding logic
- Add following/stopping mode, Lane Change mode

- Add sensor models and state estimation module. 
- finish planning in local coordinates. 
- convert global coordinates to local.
- convert back to global. 


Question: 
- 每帧是要update initial conditions 包括 obstacle的位置的
- Obstacles define has a problem: Only defined bottom-left and 
  upper-right corners while assuming its edges parallel to axis. 
- is obstacle shape converted in Frenet as well?
